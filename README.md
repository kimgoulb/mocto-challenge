# MOCTO Challenge by Kim Goulbourne

### Optional Challenges
---

#### **Design/styling** >

- **Design:** I created a very basic mockup of a sign up flow and then styled it within the app. I'm not the type of designer that just enjoys making things pretty. I prefer designing based on the product objectives but wanted to flex the muscle a bit. Happy to answer light questions on my choices but it's not based on any methodologies. I just picked a font and color, gave UX some thought, and tried to maintain some level of accessibility.
- **Code:** I leveraged my personal codebase of baseline styles that I typically use when starting a new project. Then I added the custom styles for this project on top. 

### Random notes
---

- One consideration I always have when coding is how to organize code in a way that's clean and reusable. After I nailed the functionality, I spent some a little time cleaning things up on that front.
- Took me just over an hour to complete the core functionality, an hour to organize and clean up the code and two hours to design (in Sketch) and then style the form with CSS. Pretty proud of that :)
- I played with the titles of the steps to give the user some context as to which part of the sign up flow they were in. However, building this outside the context of a real product makes it weird...
